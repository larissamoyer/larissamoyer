	<h1>ISSUES</h1>


				
						<p>Uncertainty. A state of not knowing what will happen. A reason to be fearful of the future. What changes are coming? Will they be for better or for worse? What state will our Earth be in fifty years from now? When will we destroy our planet so much that it is no longer inhabitable? Will humanity live long enough to see a day when there is no discrimination or prejudice? A day when basic human rights are given to all humans, as they should be? I fear it is not possible. I fear society takes one step forward and two steps back. I am angry that people are treated unfairly for being “different.” I am angry that people’s idiosyncrasies are bashed instead of celebrated.  I am angry at how divided our country has become. But hope is a necessity. I fear if I do not have hope, the issues of our country will be far too overwhelming and I won’t be able to get up every morning. I hope that I can make a difference, make a change. I hope that my passion in design can change the world for the better.</p>
